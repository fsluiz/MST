# Degree-Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree with Quantum Walks

This repository contains an implementation of an algorithm for solving the **Degree-Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree (DC-MST)** problem, a known NP-hard problem. The algorithm leverages a combination of classical exhaustive search and quantum walk methodologies to construct and analyze MSTs under degree constraints.

## Problem Description

The DC-MST problem requires finding a spanning tree in a graph such that:

1. The total weight of the edges is minimized.
2. The degree of each node does not exceed a given maximum value (`max_degree`).

This problem is NP-hard due to the combinatorial complexity introduced by the degree constraints.

## Key Features

- **Exhaustive Search**: Provides optimal solutions for all cases where the degree constraint (`max_degree`).
- **Quantum Walk Approach**: This approach utilizes quantum walks to construct a degree-constrained MST based on transition probabilities between nodes. This approach is optimal for all cases when the max degree is greater than 4, and most cases when the max_degree is less than 4.
- **Hamiltonian Construction**: Builds a quantum Hamiltonian based on the Laplacian of the graph, incorporating degree constraints to simulate the quantum walk.
- **Visualization**: Plots the graph, the degree-constrained MST, and the quantum walk-based spanning tree for comparison.

## Algorithm Description

1. **Exhaustive Search**: 
   - Iterates through all possible combinations of edges to identify a valid spanning tree with the degree constraint.
   - Guarantees an optimal solution when `max_degree > 4`.

2. **Quantum Walk-based Approach**:
   - Simulates a quantum walk on the graph to calculate transition probabilities between nodes.
   - Constructs an MST by selecting edges with the highest transition probabilities, ensuring degree constraints are respected.
   - Provides suboptimal solutions in rare cases when `max_degree < 4`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The algorithm compares the results of the exhaustive search and quantum walk approaches to evaluate performance and solution quality.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy networkx matplotlib qutip
```

### Running the Algorithm

To execute the algorithm, modify the following parameters in the script:

- `num_nodes`: Number of nodes in the graph.
- `max_degree`: Maximum allowed degree for nodes in the MST.
- `t_max`: Time parameter for quantum walk simulation.

Run the script:

```bash
python quantum_walk_mst.py
```

### Output

- **Graphs**: Visual representation of the original graph, the degree-constrained MST (red edges), and the quantum walk-based tree (blue edges).
- **Weights**: Total weights of the MSTs generated by both approaches for comparison.

## Example

For a complete graph with 5 nodes (`num_nodes = 5`), `max_degree = 2`, and `t_max = 0.1`:

- The exhaustive search finds the optimal MST.
- The quantum walk-based method generates a tree with comparable or slightly higher weight.

## Limitations

- **Optimality**: 
  - For `max_degree > 4`, the exhaustive search and quantum walk always provide the optimal solution.
  - For `max_degree â‰¤ 4`, the quantum walk method is optimal in most cases and suboptimal in a few edge cases.
- **Scalability**: The exhaustive search is computationally expensive and impractical for large graphs due to its combinatorial complexity.

## Visualization

The script includes a plotting function that displays:

1. The original complete graph with edge weights.
2. The MST generated by the exhaustive search.
3. The tree generated by the quantum walk-based approach.
